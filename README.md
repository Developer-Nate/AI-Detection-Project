Investigating and Detecting AI generated Text 

Step 1: Media type selection
Chosen Type: Text
Rationale: AI text is easiest to generate and will be the most common. Therefore, it is important that effective tools exist to be able to detect them to preserve academic, professional, and creative integrity of written works. 

Step 2: Collected Examples:
•	Entries 1-3: Ai Generated texts using DeepSeek
•	Entries 4-6: Human Created entries (From Pre-AI literary works)

Step 3: Brainstorm Specific Traits with AI
Prompt Used: “What traits or features can be used to determine if text is AI-generated? “
AI Response:
Determining whether text is AI-generated can be challenging, as AI models like GPT-4 are designed to produce human-like text. However, there are certain traits and features that can help identify AI-generated content:

1. **Overly Formal or Neutral Tone**: AI-generated text often maintains a consistent, formal, or neutral tone, even in contexts where a human might express more emotion or variability.

2. **Lack of Personal Experience**: AI lacks personal experiences, so it may avoid or generalize topics that require subjective or anecdotal input.

3. **Repetition or Redundancy**: AI might repeat phrases or ideas, especially in longer texts, as it tries to maintain coherence.

4. **Overuse of Common Phrases**: AI often relies on common phrases, idioms, or clichés, as these are prevalent in its training data.

5. **Perfect Grammar and Syntax**: While not a definitive indicator, AI-generated text often has near-perfect grammar and syntax, which can sometimes make it seem "too polished."

6. **Vague or Generic Responses**: AI may provide broad or generic answers when it lacks specific information, avoiding deep or nuanced insights.

7. **Inconsistencies in Context**: AI might struggle with maintaining context over long passages, leading to subtle inconsistencies or shifts in focus.

8. **Over-Explanation**: AI sometimes provides excessive detail or over-explains concepts, as it tries to cover all possible angles.

9. **Lack of Typos or Errors**: Humans often make minor typos or errors, while AI-generated text is typically error-free unless intentionally programmed otherwise.

10. **Unusual Word Choices**: AI might use words or phrases that are technically correct but feel slightly off or unnatural in context.

11. **Predictable Structure**: AI-generated text often follows predictable patterns or structures, such as starting with an introduction, providing points, and concluding summarily.

12. **Difficulty with Ambiguity**: AI may struggle with ambiguous or open-ended questions, providing answers that are overly literal or avoid interpretation.

13. **Over-Reliance on Training Data**: AI might generate content that closely mirrors its training data, leading to similarities with known AI-generated texts.

14. **Lack of Emotional Depth**: While AI can mimic emotions, its expressions may lack the depth or authenticity of human emotional responses.

15. **Speed and Volume**: AI can generate large volumes of text quickly, which might be a clue if the content is produced at an unnatural speed.

These traits are not foolproof, as AI models are constantly improving and can sometimes mimic human writing very closely. Additionally, human writers may exhibit some of these traits as well. Therefore, identifying AI-generated text often requires a combination of these indicators and contextual analysis.
Traits Selected For Analysis:
1.	Repetition or Redundancy
2.	Perfect grammar and Syntax
3.	Unusual Word Choices

Step 4: Detection program Generation prompt: 
Create a Python program to determine if a text entry is AI-generated or human-generated. The program should analyze the following traits: Repetition or redundancy, Perfect Grammar and Syntax, Unusual Word Choice. Use any available text processing libraries as needed. Please include detailed comments explaining each step of the code.

Step 5: Program Testing
